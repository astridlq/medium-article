    <h2>We need to choose a title</h2>
      <p>I'm speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and I've said a lot of things. Lorem Ipsum is unattractive, both inside and out. I fully understand why it’s former users left it for something else. They made a good decision.
      An ‘extremely credible source’ has called my office and told me that Barack Obama’s placeholder text is a fraud. That other text? Sadly, it’s no longer a 10.</p>
    <h2>Let me think...</h2>
      <p>I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that wrote Lorem Ipsum, but I don't know, maybe it was. It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be some wordsmith sitting on their bed that weights 400 pounds. Ok? I know words. I have the best words.</p>

    <h2>Come on, just write something!</h2>
      <p>I have a 10 year old son. He has words. He is so good with these words it's unbelievable. It’s about making placeholder text great again. That’s what people want, they want placeholder text to be great again. An ‘extremely credible source’ has called my office and told me that Barack Obama’s placeholder text is a fraud.</p>
